  <h2>Welcome to Snowflake Landing Page Revamp Proposal!</h2>
  <p>This project is for redeveloping the landing page of Snowflake that's well integrated with other Tor Web products and builds off of user research. Snowflake helps users access the Tor network where the Tor network is censored. This project's primary objective is to translate the UI/wireframe for the website, developed by the Tor designers based on the results of the usability research, into code in order to develop the website while ensuring that the website adheres to Tor's brand guidelines and is integrated into Tor's Web ecosystem. I will follow the results of the ongoing Usability Research which will help me to understand UI and content which our user needs. I am planning to help Tor Designers in designing new UI as working on the website design which I will be building will help me to understand the user requirement and user-centered design process. I want to develop a landing page which will not compromise with the privacy of the user visiting the page and optimize it for users with mobile devices and limited battery life. I will follow the Web Privacy Standards and ensure that the visitor's privacy is not compromised. Working on this project will help me to learn how to develop secure websites by following privacy-by-design principles, translating user research findings into user interfaces, and enhancing my ability to think in the context of user-centered development.</p>
