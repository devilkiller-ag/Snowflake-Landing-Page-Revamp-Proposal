  <p>I have been inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/ParinishthaY">Parinishtha</a> who continued her journey with The Tor Project after her Outreachy Internship from Tor. After GSoC 2023, I am interested in further maintaining the repository of Snowflake Landing Page and helping new contributors. I plan to work with the UX, Web and Community Teams of The Tor Project. I am planning to develop landing pages for other pluggable transports currently supported by the Tor (obsf2, obsf3, obfs4, meek, scramblesuit, FTE, and StegoTorus) and work on every website of The Tor Project after GSoC 2023 to update them by applying a user-centered design approach which I will learn while working on this project. If it allows, I also want to be a mentor in future Open-Source Events like GSoC and Outreachy where The Tor Project takes part in. This will help me to develop mentoring skills, learn from participants, and contribute further to The Tor Project.</p>
