The Tor Browser has been a valuable platform for me to excel in my academia without negotiating with my privacy. I have been using The Tor Browser to get access to educational websites and resources which are banned in my country. It has also protected my personal information from being accessed by third parties and helped me avoid annoying advertisements and spams. I am a firm believer of the idea that internet users should have private access to an uncensored web. I have been exploring the Tor Community and learning about the Tor Culture. The idea of putting users in the center of the development process and using this to make privacy-enhancing technology accessible to all is what matches with my ideology of developing projects keeping the target audience in mind and has driven me to contribute to The Tor Project.
