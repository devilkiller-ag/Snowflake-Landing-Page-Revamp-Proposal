Open Source Culture has been the driving force I was able to start my career in technology. All the open source study resources like MDN Web Docs, FreeCodeCamp  and Open Source Events like Hacktoberfest have made me learn all the skills I have today. I am a firm believer in the potential of open-source software to make technology more accessible to people worldwide. Google Summer of Code is one of the best open-source programs where I can gain experience of working on a real project with real users under the guidance of experienced mentors and develop skills which will help me to get future job opportunities. Working on meaningful open source projects under the guidance of mentors will help me to understand how to write clear, concise code, document it in a professional manner and know what  it takes to create high-quality software. I want to network with other developers from all over the world and become a part of a global community of developers which will allow me to learn from others, share my own experiences and give back to the open source community. Participating in GSoC will be a valuable addition to my resume and help me stand out to potential employers and clients. In addition, the stipend I will receive will help me cover the cost of my education in 2023, which will be a tremendous relief for my family and a source of pride for me.
