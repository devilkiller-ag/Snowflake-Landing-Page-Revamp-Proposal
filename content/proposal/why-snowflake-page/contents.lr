I am greatly influenced by the methodology of the website team of Snowflake by not rushing to building a webpage through the discussion period of GSoC and first making contributors study the ongoing usability research and understand where the page falls short on delivering the message to users and proxy operators. This way of working in the GSoC contribution period is totally different from other projects and has helped me to better understand the project and thought process of existing developers working on it. Working on this project will help me to learn how to develop secure websites by following privacy-by-design principles, translating user research findings into user interfaces, and enhancing my ability to think in the context of user-centered development. My interest and skills match the required skill set for this project making it to be a project on which I can work successfully this summer. Itâ€™s been my dream to contribute to the platform I am using for so long, and you can be assured of my motivation to complete this project.
